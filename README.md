# CrackingTheCodingInterview
Solutions to the coding problem of the famous book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

## Introduction
"Cracking the Coding Interview" is a comprehensive book that prepares you for coding interviews. It covers essential topics such as data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. This repository aims to provide clear and concise solutions to the coding questions presented in the book, all written in C++.

## Why This Repository?
This repository serves multiple purposes:

1. Learning Resource: It can be used as a learning resource for those preparing for coding interviews. You can study the solutions provided here to understand how to approach and solve similar problems efficiently.

2. Practice: You can use these solutions to practice coding questions on your own. Try solving the problems first, and then compare your solutions with the ones provided here to gain insights and improve your problem-solving skills.

3. Reference: If you're stuck on a particular problem or concept, you can refer to the solutions in this repository for guidance.

## Organization
The solutions are organized by chapters corresponding to the chapters in the book. Each chapter contains solutions to the coding questions presented in that chapter. Additionally, there's a utils directory that contains utility functions and classes used across multiple solutions.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any errors in the solutions or have alternative solutions that you'd like to share, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions follow the existing coding style and include appropriate documentation and test cases.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are provided for educational purposes only. While efforts have been made to ensure correctness, there may still be mistakes or better solutions available. Use these solutions as a reference, but make sure to understand the underlying concepts and strive to solve problems on your own.
